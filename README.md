# Biological-Anthropomorphic-Intersection-with-Robotic-Cinematization
This textis a personal study on the conceptual similarities between human anatomy and robotic joints. It visually analyzes the correlation between parts of the human body (like the shoulder, elbow, and wrist) and the articulated components of a robotic arm, highlighting a key aspect of biomimetic design.
